# A Micro Blog - Candidate Code Assessment

## The Challenge

* _a micro blog_ is a micro-blog, like Twitter.
* Users can browse the list of posts, and individual posts, without logging in
* Users need to login to post

Your challenge is to add the ability to *like* posts:

> As a user,
> I want to like other users' posts
> So that they know I enjoyed what they wrote

## Expectations
* Candidates are welcome to spend as much time on this as they like, but we don't expect more than 1-2 hours effort.
* The goal is to get the feature into the application - we should be able to see your submission by running the app, not by looking at the code
* We don't expect a fully polished feature in this time, tell us in your submission what you'd do next if you had more time.

## Submission format
* Submit your assessment by forking this repository and sending us a Pull Request
* Provide any details you think we should know in the body of your pull request


## Running the application
* _a microblog_ runs on Ruby 3.0.3 and Rails 6.1.5
* Start it like any Rails app
* The app uses webpacker for styles and javascript

## Implementation Details
* [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) is used for testing
* [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) for sprinklings of javascript
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling
